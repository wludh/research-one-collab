**CFP for Collaboration between W&L and UVA for Graduate Student Visits**

Funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Washington and Lee University is collaborating with the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia to bring UVA graduate students to give presentations or workshops on their digital research to enrich undergraduate courses at W&L. The grant aims to give graduate students the opportunity to develop workshop materials based on their work in digital humanities and to gain experience teaching in a liberal arts context in preparation for the job market. W&L courses and students gain contact with cutting edge digital research and pedagogy.

Graduate students who participate receive a $500 honorarium in exchange for their work consulting with the W&L faculty member, preparing and delivering their materials in a course visit, and then following up with the faculty member afterwards. We will work to match interested students with appropriate W&L courses. The opportunities are numerous, and we are happy to work with you to develop something productive for both faculty member and graduate student. These framing questions might help:

* How might you take your research interests as they pertain to digital humanities and articulate them to undergraduates in a single class session?
* How can you imagine reshaping your project into a teaching workshop?
* What hands-on activities can you use to shape a discussion of the work for newcomers?
* How can you connect your interest to the particular course topic?

Participants are encouraged to use this opportunity to try out new ideas, crystallize research interests, and to experiment. No particular experience teaching or working with digital humanities is required – just an interest.

Some past presentations have included:

* Basics of project management with a workshop on writing charters (documents to establish goals and rules for the team) for a DH intro course
* Introduction to web design by discussing “bad” websites for a DH intro course
* Discussion of use of digital humanities for theatre followed by a Prism game asking students to map stage directions in Hamlet for a course on King Lear
* Introduction to text analysis through a hands-on exercise on topic modeling for an intro to DH course
* Lecture on the history of technology in fashion and hands-on sewing workshop for a seminar on Fashion in Global History, drawing on grad student’s own research in wearable technology
* Design jams for helping students scope, shape, and develop their own course projects

Participants are encouraged to cross post to both the Scholars' Lab and WLUDH blogs after participating to document their work. You can find past posts [here](http://digitalhumanities.wlu.edu/blog/category/uva-collaboration/).
