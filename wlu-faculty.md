**CFP for Collaboration between W&L and UVA for Graduate Student Visits**

Funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Washington and Lee University is collaborating with the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia to bring UVA graduate students to give presentations or workshops on their digital research to enrich undergraduate courses at W&L. The grant aims to give students and faculty in W&L courses exposure to cutting edge pedagogy and digital tools.

We will work to match interested faculty members with graduate students in appropriate W&L courses. The opportunities are numerous, and we are happy to work with you to develop something productive for both faculty member and graduate student. These framing questions might help:

* What broad topics does your course overlap with, and how might a digital humanities speaker or workshop address them?
* What hands-on activities can you imagine to link your course materials to digital humanities research?
* How might your course topic be enriched by an outside course visit?

Some past presentations have included:

* Basics of project management with a workshop on charters (documents to describe goals and rules for the team) for a DH intro course
* Introduction to web design by discussing “bad” websites for a DH intro course
* Discussion of use of DH for theatre followed by a Prism game asking students to map stage directions in Hamlet, for a course on King Lear
* Introduction to text analysis through a hands-on exercise on topic modeling for an intro to DH course
* Lecture on the history of technology in fashion and hands-on sewing workshop for a seminar on Fashion in Global History, drawing on grad student’s own research in wearable technology
* Design jams for helping students scope, shape, and develop their own course projects

We welcome suggestions for both winter spring term courses.
